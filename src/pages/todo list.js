                 <li>I want to start working on my layout and seperate my different sections of the page.</li>
                 <li>There's an idea of a theme that I have in mind that I'm looking to start implementing them by next week.</li>

                 <li>I watch a lot of movies and enjoy doing that so I want to have a special place for my opinions on movies
                      or something like that somewhere on my site!</li>
                 <li>I would also like to start this tutorial.</li> <a href="https://reactjs.org/tutorial/tutorial.html">Tic Tac Toe</a>
          
          <h2>TODO 2.0:</h2>
          
             <li>Basically the same as last time since I didn't go through them this week!</li>
             <li>I would also like to start focusing much more on REACT and Typescript which I believe I will get the 
                chance to do once I start working on the Navigation Bar and Tic Tac Toe game.
             </li>
             <li>I'm going to rewatch Dr.Bart's lecture from today (9/16/21) and try to implement the tricks he showed us for my own ideas.</li>
             <li>Fix email part up above to include an enter button.</li>
          
          <h2>TODO 3.0:</h2>
          
              <li>Mess around with the format of my page and fix things around like the style/other CSS properties.</li>
              <li>Implement a scratch off game under Movies tab.</li><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6CKW7tLv5e0">Scratch Off Starting Point</a>
              <li>Try to make my page more mobile friendly</li><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D2HZQeqFu6w">Following This</a>
              <li>Add more pictures and work on the tabs that are still empty with CSS.</li>
              <li>Finish my TODO List app and maybe transfer it here to place under my ToDo tab with the tutorial under change log 3.0</li>
              <li>Change the Logo/home tab with an actual logo as instructed on the NavBar tutorial that I used. (link can be found under resources)</li>
