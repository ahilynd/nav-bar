          <p>I know it can't really be seen on the change log but this week
            I've been trying to work my way around VSCode and connecting it to my repository on github.
            It has been frustrating because I feel like I'm following instructions/tutorials and not getting the right results. I am
            definetely dissapointed in my performance this week for my Portfolio, but I feel like taking the time I did
            to better my understand on VSCode/git/commit/push will definitely help me more in the future in this class. 
            I will provide screenshots to show my failures so that can be used as my change log for this week! Next week will
            be better! *spongebob voice* "Three hours later" -- it's been much later since I typed this reflection down, but I solved my
            issues with git that I mentioned, I finally succeeded in connecting VSCode to github with the help of my TA and some online 
            articles that will be linked above.
