          <p>I know it can't really be seen on the change log but this week
             I've been trying to work my way around VSCode and connecting it to my repository on github. 
          It has been frustrating because I feel like I'm following instructions/tutorials and not getting the right results.
          I am definetely dissapointed in my performance this week for my Portfolio, but I feel like taking the time I did
            to better my understand on VSCode/git/commit/push will definitely help me more in the future in this class. 
            "Three hours later" -- it's been much later since I typed this reflection down, but I solved my
            issues with git that I mentioned, I finally succeeded in connecting VSCode to github with the help of my TA and some online 
            articles that will be under Resources.

                 This week I struggled with tranferring my REACT app to my github pages. For some reason 
                 I couldn't connect it to my original main repository. After finding out a solution with
                 a new repository I made changes to make my new repository my main one since I couldn't 
                 find a solution for my old main one. Through the guidance of my TA and a bunch of different 
                 tutorials that will be linked under my resources, I can now say that I feel comfortable
                 transferring code from VSCode to my GitHub pages. It was very frustrating to say the least at
                 first, but the way my page is turning out to be has been worth it and I'm excited to continue
                 making progress on REACT and learn more tricks.
